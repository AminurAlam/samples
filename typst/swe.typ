= Model Selection

The choice of a software development model significantly impacts the success and
maintainability of an open-source navigation project. The two primary models to consider
are Waterfall and Agile.

== The Waterfall Model

The Waterfall model is a traditional, linear, and sequential approach where the entire
development process is divided into distinct, non-overlapping phases (Requirements,
Design, Implementation, Verification, Maintenance). Each phase must be completed and
signed off before the next phase can begin.

#figure(image("assets/waterfall.svg", width: auto), caption: [Waterfall Model])

Pros:
- / Simplicity and Structure: It is easy to understand, manage, and define
    clear milestones, making it suitable for projects with stable, clearly
    defined requirements and a predictable timeline.
- / Strong Documentation: Since all requirements and design decisions are
    finalized upfront, it enforces comprehensive documentation at the beginning
    of the project, which can be valuable for long-term knowledge transfer.
- / Predictable Budget: The fixed scope and sequence allow for more accurate
    upfront estimation of costs and deadlines.

Cons:
- / Lack of Flexibility: The model is highly rigid. Once a phase is completed,
    it is extremely difficult and costly to go back and modify requirements or
    designs, making it unsuitable for projects where user needs or technology
    are likely to evolve a certainty in navigation software.
- / Late Feedback: Users only see the final, fully built product late in the
    development cycle, which risks discovering major flaws or misinterpretations
    of the initial requirements too late to easily fix.
- / High Upfront Investment: A significant amount of time and resources must be
    spent defining everything at the start, potentially delaying the first usable release.

== The Agile Model

The Agile model is an iterative and incremental approach that focuses on flexibility,
collaboration, and the delivery of working software in short cycles (sprints). It
prioritizes customer (user/community) feedback and welcomes changes throughout the
development lifecycle.

#figure(image("assets/agile.svg", width: 80%), caption: [Agile Model])

Pros:
- / Adaptability and Flexibility: Agile embraces change and evolving requirements.
    It is perfectly suited for dynamic projects like open-source navigation, which
    need to constantly adapt to new map data, user needs, and routing algorithms.
- / Continuous Feedback and Integration: Working software is delivered frequently,
    allowing the user community to test and provide immediate feedback that can be
    incorporated into the very next iteration. This drastically reduces the risk of
    building the wrong product.
- / Community Alignment: The transparency and emphasis on collaboration in Agile
    strongly align with the decentralized, community-driven nature of open-source
    development, encouraging continuous contributions from a wide range of developers.
- / Faster Time to Market: Functioning, though incomplete, versions of the software
    are released quickly, providing early value to users and attracting further contributions.

Cons:
- / Less Predictable: The flexible nature can make defining a final scope and
    predicting the overall timeline and cost more challenging than in the Waterfall model.
- / Requires Active Collaboration: Agile demands constant communication and a high
    level of involvement from the project maintainers and core community, which can
    be difficult to manage in a purely volunteer-based open-source setting.
- / Documentation Risk: If not strictly managed, the focus on working software over
    comprehensive documentation can lead to a knowledge gap over time, particularly
    for volunteer developers who may join and leave the project.

== Conclusion

For building an open-source navigation software, the Agile Model is overwhelmingly the
most suitable choice. The inherent need for continuous updates (due to map changes),
constant feature requests, and reliance on decentralized community feedback makes the
rigid, sequential Waterfall model unworkable. The iterative, flexible nature of Agile
is essential for attracting and retaining an active contributor base and ensuring the
navigation software can rapidly evolve and remain relevant in a dynamic technological
environment.

= Maintainability of the Product

The long-term maintainability of a navigation software is fundamentally tied to
its architectural clarity and community engagement. Since the project relies on
external, constantly evolving data (OpenStreetMap) and external services (OSRM),
maintainability requires a modular design that isolates the map display, the routing
service interaction, and the user interface. Using established, well-documented
technologies like Leaflet and OSRM reduces the burden on maintainers, as they are
backed by large communities. Furthermore, consistent code quality, comprehensive inline
documentation, and an organized contribution process are crucial. A maintainable project
is one where new volunteers can quickly understand the codebase, identify where to fix
bugs, and seamlessly integrate new features without breaking existing functionality,
thereby ensuring the software's longevity.

== Building tools

Selecting the right tools is crucial for efficiency, performance, and community
growth. For an open-source navigation project, the ideal tools should be robust,
have strong community support. The initial choice of Leaflet, OSRM, and OpenStreetMap
is excellent because they represent industry standards in the open-source mapping
space. Beyond these core components, the technology stack should favor lightweight,
well-documented libraries that have a low learning curve to maximize the pool
of potential contributors. Decisions should prioritize technologies that offer the
best balance between high performance for real-time routing and ease of integration
with the existing open-source ecosystem.

= Feasiblity Study

The main focus of this stage is to determine whether it would be financially and
technically feasible to develop the software. The feasibility study involves carrying
out several activities such as collection of basic information relating to the software
such as the different data items that would be input to the system, the processing
required to be carried out on these data, the output data required to be produced by
the system, as well as various constraints on the development.

The proposed project is the development of a software application designed to calculate
and visualize the optimal route between two geographic locations. This study assesses
the technical, operational, and financial viability of the project. For the project
we are building we will need the following:

- / Map Data: Road networks, Nodes, Edges, Speed limits
- / Map Tiles: For visual interaction
- / Geocoding: Converting text addresses into geographic coordinates
- / Pathfinding Algorithms: Implementation of graph traversal algorithms
    to determine the route
- / Heuristic Calculation: Adjusting the route based on weights such as speed
    limits and live traffic delays
- / ETA Calculation: Estimating arrival time based on distance and average
    speed/traffic flow
- / Turn-by-Turn Instructions: Text or voice commands

The project is Technically Feasible but might carry high financial risk due to API
costs and market saturation unless a specific niche like trucking, hiking, or indoor
navigation is targeted.

== Understanding the problem

It is necessary to first develop an overall understanding of what the customer requires
to be developed. For this, only the important requirements of the customer need to be
understood and the details of various requirements such as the screen layouts required
in the graphical user interface, specific formulas or algorithms required for
producing the required results, and the databases schema to be used are ignored.

== Formulation of various possible strategies for solving the problem

In this activity, various possible high-level solution schemes to the problem
are determined. For example, solution in a client-server framework and a standalone
application framework may be explored.

== Evaluation of the different solution strategies

The different identified solution schemes are analysed to evaluate their benefits
and shortcomings. Such evaluation often requires making approximate estimates of the
resources required, cost of development, and development time required. The different
solutions are compared based on the estimations that have been worked out. Once the
best solution is identified, all activities in the later phases are carried out as per
this solution. At this stage, it may also be determined that none of the solutions
is feasible due to high cost, resource constraints, or some technical reasons. This
scenario would, of course, require the project to be abandoned.

For our Map Tiles, OpenStreetMap serves as the foundational data source for the entire
application. It is a community-driven, global map that provides the raw geographic
information, including the road network, points of interest, and map features, which
is essential for both rendering the map tiles and calculating accurate routes. The map
tiles are often sourced directly from the standard OpenStreetMap tile servers or from
a third-party tile provider that uses OSM data

= Requirement Analysis

The aim of the requirements analysis and specification phase is to understand the exact
requirements of the customer and to document them properly. This phase consists of
two distinct activities, namely requirements gathering, and requirements
specification.

== Requirements gathering

The goal of the requirements gathering activity is to collect all relevant information
regarding the software to be developed from the customer with a view to clearly
understand the requirements. For this, first requirements are gathered from the customer
and then the gathered requirements are analysed. The goal of the requirements analysis
activity is to weed out the incompleteness and inconsistencies in these gathered
requirements. Note that an inconsistent requirement is one in which some part of the
requirement contradicts some other part. On the other hand, an incomplete requirement
is one in which some parts of the actual requirements have been omitted.

== Software Requirements specification (SRS)

After the requirement gathering and analysis activities
are complete, the identified requirements are documented. This document is called
a software requirements specification (SRS) document. The SRS document is written
using end-user terminology. This makes the SRS document understandable to the
customer. Therefore, understandability of the SRS document is an important issue.
The SRS document normally serves as a contract between the development team and
the customer. Any future dispute between the customer and the developers can be
settled by examining the SRS document. The SRS document is therefore an important
document which must be thoroughly understood by the development team, and
reviewed jointly with the customer. The SRS document not only forms the basis for
carrying out all the development activities, but several documents such as users’
manuals, system test plan, etc. are prepared directly based on it. In Chapter 4, we
examine the requirements analysis activity and various issues involved in developing
a good SRS document in more detail.

= Routing Data

#figure(image("assets/data.svg"), caption: [data processing pipeline])

== Extraction process

The map data is updated everyday with a version of the planet file from the latest
OpenStreetMap data and is split into a number of pre-defined regions. This is done
using the Osmosis and osmium programs (Osmosis to download updates, Osmium to apply
them and split).

Polygonal boundaries are used for the splitting boundaries that are sometiems derived
and simplified from OSM data, sometimes just hand-drawn. The boundaries usually follow
country borders. The Osmium extract function keeps ways and multipolygon relations
that cross an extract border complete

== Polygon files

The .poly files that you can download reflect the exact clipping boundary that we
use in generating the extract, and can be used with programs like Osmosis, Osmium,
or Osmconvert to generate the extract from a larger file. The KML files are the same
data, just in different format.

== PBF files

The .osm.pbf data format is the common format for the exchange of raw OpenStreetMap
data. It is fast to read and write and can be directly processed by most programs
dealing with OSM data. Our .osm.pbf file is original OSM data and contains all data
and metadata available in OSM for the region; the only thing they don't contain is
history. The .osh.pbf format is for history files.

== Shape files

The .shp.zip files contain a number of shape layers. In contrast to the pbf files, the
shape files are not complete. The shape files have the same structure as shape files
we make to order, but the free files contain fewer layers, and are only available for
smaller areas.  Whenever getting a new exctract for a region, we also use the difference
between the new extract and the previous one, so that users can continuously update
their own regional data instead of having to download the full file.

= Backend architecture

The backend architecture is best designed such that the heavy lifting of pathfinding is
isolated from the application logic. The core consists of two primary services: the OSRM
Routing Engine and the Application API Layer. The OSRM engine is a high-performance C++
service that holds the road network graph in memory and exposes a raw HTTP endpoint
for routing queries. It does not handle user authentication, database storage, or
business logic. This server accepts requests from client applications on the website,
validates coordinates, and then internally queries the OSRM engine. This separation
ensures that the routing engine remains purely focused on calculating directions,
while the application layer handles the of the user interaction.

Before the routing engine can accept requests, raw map data must be processed into a
routable graph. Berlin was chosen here because of its small size and high information.
Setting up the server begins by downloading the raw OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for Berlin.
A reliable source is Geofabrik, which provides region-specific extracts. This gives
us berlin-latest.osm.pbf file, which is a compressed binary protocol buffer format
containing all nodes, ways, and relations for the city.
OSRM uses `profiles` (Lua scripts) to determine which ways are
routable. For a standard car routing app, the `car.lua` profile was used.  This script
defines speeds for different road types  and restrictions.

Next we run these three commands:

- / osrm-extract: Parses the .osm.pbf file using the `car.lua` profile to create a
    preliminary graph.
- / osrm-partition: recursively partitions the graph into cells to speed up the search algorithm.
- / osrm-customize: calculates the weights (travel times) for each cell. This process
    results in a set of .osrm files that the engine loads into RAM.

Once the data is prepared, the OSRM backend is deployed as a Docker container to ensure
consistency and ease of deployment. The container mounts the directory containing
the processed Berlin graph files. Executing the osrm-routed command, specifying the
algorithm (MLD) and the path to the graph data. By default, this service listens on
port 5000. Once running, this service provides endpoints like /route, /nearest, and
/table, but it is intended for internal network access rather than public exposure.

== Setup script
#zebraw(
  lang: false,
  numbering-separator: true,
  raw(
    read("assets/start-backend.fish", encoding: "utf8").slice(0, -1),
    lang: "fish",
    block: true,
    tab-size: 2,
  ),
)

This fish shell script is an automated workflow written to launch a Dockerized Open
Source Routing Machine (OSRM) server specifically for the Berlin region. It manages
by first creating a working directory and checking for the presence of the raw Berlin
OpenStreetMap data, downloading it from Geofabrik via aria2c only if necessary. The
script then executes the OSRM data processing pipeline (extract, partition,
and customize) using the Multi-Level Dijkstra (MLD) algorithm and the standard car
profile, while employing conditional checks to skip these resource-intensive steps
if the generated graph files already exist. Finally, it mounts the processed data and
starts the osrm-routed HTTP server on localhost port 5000, effectively rendering the
Berlin map data ready for routing queries.

#figure(image("assets/server start.png"), caption: [logs of server starting up])

== Response
OSRM returns a JSON object containing waypoints (snapped to the nearest road) and
routes. The routes array contains the geometry and legs, which detail the specific
turn-by-turn maneuvers. The backend transforms this raw data into a clean JSON format
required by the frontend, adding estimated arrival times (ETA) before sending it back
to the client.

= Frontend

#figure(image("assets/frontend.svg", width: 85%), caption: [application structure])

#pagebreak()

== HTML

#zebraw(
  lang: false,
  numbering-separator: true,
  raw(
    read("assets/index.html", encoding: "utf8").slice(0, -1),
    lang: "html",
    block: true,
    tab-size: 2,
  ),
)

This HTML document serves as the frontend presentation layer or canvas for the navigation
application. The file includes viewport configuration so the map renders correctly across
different device sizes, particularly on mobile screens. The body of the page is minimal,
consisting almost entirely of a single division element (`<div id="map"></div>`). This
container is where the mapping library will put the interactive map tiles, routes,
and controls, effectively turning the entire web page into a full-screen navigation
interface.

The functionality of the application relies on two external libraries. Leaflet is
imported to provide the fundamental open-source mapping engine, which handles tile
rendering and user interaction like panning and zooming. Second, Leaflet Routing Machine
is included; this is the specific plugin that draws the route lines on the map and
generates the turn-by-turn text instructions, acting as the interface for the OSRM
backend. The document loads a local JavaScript file named `routing.js`. This is the
main part of the application. After loading the libraries, it is inside `routing.js`
that the map is actually initialized, the OSRM server endpoint is configured, and the
routing control is done.

== JavaScript

#zebraw(
  lang: false,
  numbering-separator: true,
  raw(
    read("assets/routing.js", encoding: "utf8").slice(0, -1),
    lang: "js",
    block: true,
    tab-size: 2,
  ),
)

This JavaScript code utilizes Leaflet, a popular open-source library for interactive
maps, to initialize a web-based mapping interface specifically tailored for a routing
and navigation context. The code sets up the initial map view, defines various map styles
called tile layers, distinguishes between background maps and data overlays, and creates
a user interface control that allows the user to toggle between these different views.

The code begins by creating a map instance linked to an HTML element with the ID
`map`. The `.setView` method immediately centers the map on specific coordinates
`[52.517389, 13.395131]`, which corresponds to Berlin, Germany, at a zoom level of 13.
This zoom level is close enough to see street layouts and neighborhoods, which is
ideal for starting a navigation.

The core of the visualization relies on Tile Layers sets of images loaded from a server
to form the map background. The code defines four distinct base layers:
- / OSM: The default OpenStreetMap layer, useful for general orientation.
- / OSM Humanitarian: OSM tiles following Humanitarian OpenStreetMap style.
- / Stadia Smooth: A visually simplified map provided by Stadia Maps.
- / Berlin Satellite: It pulls high-resolution aerial imagery specifically for Berlin.

#grid(
  columns: 2,
  gutter: 10pt,
  figure(image("assets/map osm.png"), caption: [OSM]), figure(image("assets/map hot.png"), caption: [OSM Humanitarian]),
  figure(image("assets/map sat.png"), caption: [Satellite]),
  figure(image("assets/map stadia.png"), caption: [Stadia Smooth]),
)

The `L.Routing.control` introduces the actual engine of the application.
While the previous code set up the visual map, this snippet activates
the routing logic, allowing the application to calculate paths between coordinates,
display turn-by-turn instructions, and interactively modify the journey.
The code creates an instance of `L.Routing.control`, which is the core interface for
navigation. Upon initialization, it is immediately assigned two Waypoints: a starting
point (`52.51, 13.395`) and a destination (`52.52, 13.396`). These coordinates are
hardcoded to initialize the map with a pre-calculated route visible immediately
when the page loads, ensuring the user doesn't see an empty interface. This control
also automatically generates a text-based itinerary container (usually a box in the
top-right corner) listing the distance, time, and specific turns required to travel
between these points.

2. Custom Routing Backend Configuration
A critical configuration line here is `serviceUrl: document.baseURI + "route/v1"`. By default, Leaflet Routing Machine connects to a public demonstration server (OSRM). However, this line overrides that behavior to point to a local or custom-hosted routing service.
- `document.baseURI` fetches the current address of the website.
- It appends `"route/v1"`, which implies that the application is talking to its own backend API to get directions.
This suggests the application is self-contained, likely running its own instance of the OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) engine, giving the developers control over the routing algorithm (e.g., customizing it specifically for bike paths or restricted service roads).

3. Interactive User Experience (UX)
The settings `routeWhileDragging: true` and `routeDragInterval: 100` are designed to make the map feel responsive and modern.
- routeWhileDragging: Allows the user to grab the blue path line or a marker on the map and drag it to a different road. As they drag, the route recalculates visually in real-time, rather than waiting for them to drop the pin.
- routeDragInterval: This is a performance optimization. It creates a "debounce" effect, ensuring the application only requests a new route calculation every 100 milliseconds during a drag action. This prevents the browser and the server from crashing due to thousands of requests being fired instantly while the user moves the mouse.

4. Click-to-Update Logic
The final block, `map.on("click", ...)` adds an event listener that fundamentally changes how the user interacts with the destination.
- When the user clicks anywhere on the map, the function executes `control.spliceWaypoints`.
- It targets the last waypoint in the list (`length - 1`).
- It removes 1 item (the current destination).
- It inserts `e.latlng` (the coordinates of the mouse click).
- The Result: Instead of adding a new stop to a multi-stop journey, this logic updates the destination. If the user clicks a new spot on the map, the route automatically recalculates from the original start point to this new clicked location.
